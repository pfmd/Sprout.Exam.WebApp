If we are going to deploy this on production,
I think the next improvement we need is to have a features for managing the salary,deductions, OTs and etc of each employee and all this information must reflect on database and have a UI. We also need a feature for processing payslip which is based on salary details of each of employee.
Payslip details of each employee per cut-off must be save on database so we can still track their record if needed.

The calculation must be improved:
Additional computation like Undertime, Night differential, holiday, Over Time, holiday Over time, SL, VL, SSS,PAGIBIG, Philhealth, and etc.

Search functionality for employee record, So it's easier to find the specific employee.

We also need to add more details on employee like Datehired, dateresigned, contact information, number of leaves and etc.

By doing this, the calculation for employee will become  flexible and will have the ability to cater all employees with different salaries.
Its also good to have a attendance record so we can automatate the calculation of late, undertime, and other details needed.
